Welcome to **Speed Typer** - where fingers fly and keyboards cry! This app helps you measure and improve your typing speed in a fun, distraction-free environment.

## 🚧 Work in Progress 🚧

This project is an ongoing experiment built with Nuxt 3, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It's also my playground for experimenting with AI-assisted development using Aider!

Think of it as a digital gym for your fingers - but without the monthly membership fees.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time WPM (Words Per Minute) calculation
- Visual feedback on typing accuracy
- Minimalist, distraction-free interface
- Press Enter to focus and start typing anytime

## 🛠️ Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies with your favorite package manager
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or

```

## 🏃‍♂️ Development

```bash

npm run dev
# or

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` and start typing!
